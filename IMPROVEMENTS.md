## üåü Key Features That Make This "More Useful"

### 1. PHIVOLCS Intensity Scale Integration
**Why it matters:** Most Filipinos don't understand magnitude numbers. The PEIS scale (I-X) tells you what to actually expect.

**What you get:**
- Intensity I: "Scarcely Perceptible" (barely noticeable)
- Intensity V: "Strong" (many people frightened)
- Intensity VIII: "Very Destructive" (many buildings damaged)
- Intensity X: "Completely Devastating" (mass destruction)

**Real-world impact:** Users can immediately understand if they should:
- Continue normal activities (I-III)
- Be cautious (IV-V)
- Take cover (VI-VII)
- Evacuate (VIII-X)

### 2. Emergency Shelter Locator
**Why it matters:** During emergencies, knowing WHERE to go is critical.

**What you get:**
- Pre-verified evacuation centers
- Capacity information (can it hold you + family?)
- Contact numbers (call ahead to check availability)
- Facilities list (medical station? water? food?)
- Distance calculation (how far to safety?)

**Real-world impact:** In Southern Leyte, users know about:
- Maasin City Sports Complex (500 capacity)
- SLSU Gymnasium (800 capacity)
- Sogod Municipal Gym (400 capacity)

### 3. Multi-Region Coverage
**Why it matters:** Earthquakes don't respect municipal boundaries.

**What you get:**
- Monitor your specific region (Southern Leyte, Metro Manila, etc.)
- Or view nationwide activity
- Risk level awareness (High/Moderate/Low)
- Automatic map adjustments for each region

**Real-world impact:**
- Metro Manila residents can monitor West Valley Fault
- Mindanao residents can track their highly active zone
- Families can monitor multiple regions where relatives live

### 4. Advanced Statistics Dashboard
**Why it matters:** Understanding patterns helps communities prepare.

**What you get:**
- Activity trends (Is activity increasing? Stable?)
- Hourly updates (What happened in last 60 minutes?)
- Geographic hotspots (Which areas are most active?)
- Significant event tracking (How many M‚â•5.0 today?)

**Real-world impact:** Communities can:
- Identify if they're in a seismically active period
- Plan emergency drills during stable periods
- Allocate resources to most affected areas

### 5. Bilingual Support (English + Filipino)
**Why it matters:** 92+ million Filipinos speak Filipino/Tagalog as primary language.

**What you get:**
- Complete UI in Filipino
- Safety instructions in native language
- Emergency contacts in Filipino
- Cultural context and terminology

**Real-world impact:**
- Elderly residents can use the system
- Rural communities get information in their language
- Better community engagement and trust
