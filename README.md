# üåè Southern Leyte Earthquake Alert System

A comprehensive, real-time earthquake monitoring and alert system specifically designed for Southern Leyte, Philippines. This Progressive Web Application provides live earthquake data from USGS API, instant alerts using SweetAlert2, interactive maps, community check-in features, and educational resources.

**Developer:** John Rish Ladica - Southern Leyte, Philippines

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclaimer:** This is an independent system created by a developer from Southern Leyte. It is NOT an official government system. The system uses publicly available APIs (USGS Earthquake API) to fetch earthquake data. Any inaccuracies in the data are from the source API, not from this system. Always follow official government alerts and guidelines from PHIVOLCS and NDRRMC.

## üî• Firebase Integration

The system uses Firebase for real-time data storage and notifications. To enable Firebase:

1. **Create a Firebase Project:**
   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Create a new project
   - Enable Firestore Database
   - Enable Authentication (optional for user management)

2. **Configure Firebase:**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your Firebase config:
   ```env
   VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
   VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
   VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
   VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
   VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
   VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id
   ```
   
   - Or set these as environment variables in your deployment platform
   - For GitHub Actions, add these as repository secrets

3. **Firebase Initialization:**
   - Firebase is automatically initialized when valid credentials are provided
   - The system will use placeholder values if no credentials are configured
   - Check the console for "‚úÖ Firebase initialized successfully" message

4. **Firestore Structure:**
   ```
   /alerts
     - magnitude: number
     - place: string
     - time: timestamp
     - location: string
   
   /subscriptions
     - threshold: number
     - location: string
     - userId: string (optional)
   ```

**Current Implementation:** The system stores data locally for demonstration. For production, implement proper Firebase integration.

## üìä API Data Sources

### Primary Data Source: USGS Earthquake API
- **Endpoint:** `https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson`
- **Update Frequency:** Every 60 seconds
- **Geographic Filter:** Philippines region (4.5¬∞N-21¬∞N, 116¬∞E-127¬∞E)
- **Note:** All earthquake data comes from USGS. Any inaccuracies are from the source API, not this application.

- **NDRRMC:** For disaster response coordination
- Always follow official government alerts and guidelines

## üé® Customization

### Modify Alert Thresholds
Edit `src/earthquakeService.ts`:
```typescript
getMagnitudeColor(magnitude: number): string {
  if (magnitude >= 7.0) return '#dc2626'; // Major - Red
  if (magnitude >= 5.5) return '#f97316'; // Strong - Orange
  if (magnitude >= 4.0) return '#facc15'; // Moderate - Yellow
  return '#16a34a'; // Minor - Green
}
```

### Update Map Center and Zoom for Southern Leyte
Edit `src/mapService.ts`:
```typescript
this.map = L.map(containerId).setView([10.3, 125.0], 10);
```

### Customize Earthquake Bounds
Edit `src/earthquakeService.ts`:
```typescript
const SOUTHERN_LEYTE_BOUNDS = {
  minLat: 9.8,
  maxLat: 10.8,
  minLng: 124.5,
  maxLng: 125.5,
};
```

### Customize Colors
Edit `tailwind.config.js`:
