# üåè Southern Leyte Earthquake Alert System

A comprehensive, real-time earthquake monitoring and alert system specifically designed for Southern Leyte, Philippines. This Progressive Web Application provides live earthquake data from USGS API, instant alerts using SweetAlert2, interactive maps, community check-in features, and educational resources.

**Developer:** John Rish Ladica - Southern Leyte, Philippines

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclaimer:** This is an independent system created by a developer from Southern Leyte. It is NOT an official government system. The system uses publicly available APIs (USGS Earthquake API) to fetch earthquake data. Any inaccuracies in the data are from the source API, not from this system. Always follow official government alerts and guidelines from PHIVOLCS and NDRRMC.

## üî• Firebase Integration

The system uses Firebase for real-time data storage and notifications. To enable Firebase:

1. **Create a Firebase Project:**
   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Create a new project
   - Enable Firestore Database
   - Enable Authentication (optional for user management)

2. **Configure Firebase:**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your Firebase config:
   ```env
   VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
   VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
   VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
   VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
   VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
   VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id
   ```
   
   - Or set these as environment variables in your deployment platform
   - For GitHub Actions, add these as repository secrets

3. **Firebase Initialization:**
   - Firebase is automatically initialized when valid credentials are provided
   - The system will use placeholder values if no credentials are configured
   - Check the console for "‚úÖ Firebase initialized successfully" message

   service cloud.firestore {
     match /databases/{database}/documents {
       // Allow read access to all documents
       match /{document=**} {
         allow read: if true;
       }
       
       // Community News - authenticated users only
       match /communityNews/{newsId} {
         allow create: if request.auth != null;
         allow update: if request.auth != null && 
                       (request.resource.data.hearts == resource.data.hearts + 1 ||
                        request.resource.data.hearts == resource.data.hearts - 1);
       }
       
       // Earthquake Reports - authenticated users only
       match /earthquakeReports/{reportId} {
         allow create: if request.auth != null;
         allow update: if request.auth != null;
       }
       
       // Comments - authenticated users only
       match /earthquakeComments/{commentId} {
         allow create: if request.auth != null;
         allow delete: if request.auth != null && 
                       resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
       }
       
       // Earthquake Edits - admin only
       match /earthquakeEdits/{editId} {
         allow write: if request.auth != null && 
                      request.auth.token.email == 'admin@johnrish.website';
       }
     }
   }
   ```

**Current Implementation:** The system stores data locally for demonstration. For production, implement proper Firebase integration.
