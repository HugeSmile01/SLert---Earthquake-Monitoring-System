## üì± Email Alert Configuration

The system is ready for email integration with various email service providers.

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** For production use, email sending MUST be implemented server-side. Never expose API keys in the client-side code.

### To Enable Email Alerts:

1. **Set up a backend API server** (Required for production):
   - Create a Node.js/Express backend or serverless function
   - Store API keys securely on the server
   - Implement email sending endpoints

2. **Choose an email service provider:**
   - **SendGrid:** https://sendgrid.com/
   - **Mailgun:** https://www.mailgun.com/
   - **Amazon SES:** https://aws.amazon.com/ses/

3. **Example Backend Implementation** (Node.js/Express):
   ```javascript
   // server.js
   const express = require('express');
   const sgMail = require('@sendgrid/mail');
   
   sgMail.setApiKey(process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY); // Server-side only!
   
   app.post('/api/subscribe', async (req, res) => {
     const { email, threshold, location } = req.body;
     
     // Validate inputs server-side
     // Store in database
     // Send confirmation email
     
     const msg = {
       to: email,
       from: 'alerts@southernleyte-earthquake.ph',
       subject: 'Earthquake Alert Subscription Confirmed',
       html: `<p>You're subscribed to alerts for ${location}</p>`
     };
     
     await sgMail.send(msg);
     res.json({ success: true });
   });
   ```

4. **Update the frontend** to call your backend API:
   ```typescript
   // In emailService.ts, replace the subscribeEmail method:
   const response = await fetch('/api/subscribe', {
     method: 'POST',
     headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
     body: JSON.stringify({ email, threshold, location })
   });
   ```

5. **Environment variables (server-side only):**
   ```env
   SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_api_key
   EMAIL_FROM=alerts@your-domain.com
   DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
   ```

**Current Implementation:** The frontend currently stores subscriptions locally for demonstration. For production, implement a proper backend.

## üî• Firebase Integration (Optional)

For advanced features like user authentication and persistent data storage:

1. **Create a Firebase project** at https://console.firebase.google.com/

2. **Enable services:**
   - Authentication
   - Firestore Database
   - Cloud Functions

3. **Update Firebase configuration** in `src/firebase.ts`:
   ```typescript
   const firebaseConfig = {
     apiKey: "your-api-key",
     authDomain: "your-auth-domain",
     projectId: "your-project-id",
     storageBucket: "your-storage-bucket",
     messagingSenderId: "your-sender-id",
     appId: "your-app-id"
   };
   ```

4. **Uncomment Firebase initialization code** in the same file

## üìä API Data Sources

### Primary Data Source: USGS Earthquake API
- **Endpoint:** `https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson`
- **Update Frequency:** Every 60 seconds
- **Geographic Filter:** Philippines region (4.5¬∞N-21¬∞N, 116¬∞E-127¬∞E)

### Alternative/Backup Source: PHIVOLCS
- Website: https://www.phivolcs.dost.gov.ph/
- Note: PHIVOLCS doesn't provide a public API, but this system can be extended to scrape their data

## üé® Customization

### Modify Alert Thresholds
Edit `src/earthquakeService.ts`:
```typescript
getMagnitudeColor(magnitude: number): string {
  if (magnitude >= 7.0) return '#dc2626'; // Major - Red
  if (magnitude >= 5.5) return '#f97316'; // Strong - Orange
  if (magnitude >= 4.0) return '#facc15'; // Moderate - Yellow
  return '#16a34a'; // Minor - Green
}
```

### Update Map Center and Zoom for Southern Leyte
Edit `src/mapService.ts`:
```typescript
this.map = L.map(containerId).setView([10.3, 125.0], 10);
```

### Customize Earthquake Bounds
Edit `src/earthquakeService.ts`:
```typescript
const SOUTHERN_LEYTE_BOUNDS = {
  minLat: 9.8,
  maxLat: 10.8,
  minLng: 124.5,
  maxLng: 125.5,
};
```

### Customize Colors
Edit `tailwind.config.js`:
```javascript
colors: {
  'phivolcs-blue': '#003366',
  'alert-red': '#dc2626',
  'warning-yellow': '#facc15',
  'safe-green': '#16a34a',
}
```
