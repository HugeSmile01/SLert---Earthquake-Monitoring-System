# Firebase Secrets Integration Guide

## Overview
This document explains how Firebase configuration secrets from GitHub repository secrets are now connected to the application code.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `src/firebase.ts`
- Changed from hardcoded placeholder values to reading from environment variables
- Firebase is now initialized automatically when valid credentials are provided
- Graceful fallback when no credentials are configured
- Added proper TypeScript imports for Firebase services

```typescript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: import.meta.env.VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY || "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: import.meta.env.VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN || "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
  // ... other configs
};
```

### 2. Created `.env.example`
- Documents all required environment variables
- Serves as a template for local development
- Lists all Firebase configuration variables with VITE_ prefix

### 3. Updated GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
- Added environment variable mapping in the build step
- Maps GitHub secrets to VITE_ prefixed environment variables
- Secrets are injected during build time for security

```yaml
env:
  NODE_ENV: production
  VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.YOUR_API_KEY }}
  VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN: ${{ secrets.YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN }}
  # ... other secrets
```

### 4. Added TypeScript Type Definitions (`src/vite-env.d.ts`)
- Provides type safety for environment variables
- Prevents TypeScript compilation errors
- Documents available environment variables

## How It Works

### Build Time
1. GitHub Actions reads secrets from repository settings
2. Secrets are set as environment variables during `npm run build`
3. Vite injects these values into the code at build time
4. The built files contain the actual secret values (not the placeholders)

### Runtime
1. When the application loads, it reads the injected configuration
2. Firebase is initialized with the real credentials
3. The app can now connect to Firebase services

### Security
- Secrets are never committed to the repository
- Environment variables with `VITE_` prefix are the only ones exposed to client-side code
- This is safe for Firebase config as these keys are meant for client-side use
- Firebase security is handled through Firestore Security Rules, not by hiding the config

## GitHub Secrets Configuration

The following secrets need to be configured in your GitHub repository:

1. `YOUR_API_KEY` - Firebase API Key
2. `YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN` - Firebase Auth Domain  
3. `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` - Firebase Project ID
4. `YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET` - Firebase Storage Bucket
5. `YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID` - Firebase Messaging Sender ID
6. `YOUR_APP_ID` - Firebase App ID
7. `YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID` - Firebase Measurement ID (optional)

### How to Add Secrets
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Navigate to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
3. Click "New repository secret"
4. Add each secret with the exact names listed above
5. Get the values from your Firebase Console

## Local Development

For local development, create a `.env` file (not committed):

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your Firebase credentials
```

## Verification

To verify Firebase is properly configured:

1. Check browser console for: `✅ Firebase initialized successfully`
2. If you see: `⚠️ Firebase not configured`, check your environment variables
3. The build should complete without errors
4. Firebase services (Firestore, Auth) should be accessible

## Troubleshooting

### "Firebase not configured" warning
- Ensure GitHub secrets are properly set
- Verify secret names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Check that the workflow file has been updated

### Build errors
- Run `npm run type-check` to verify TypeScript compilation
- Ensure `src/vite-env.d.ts` exists
- Check that all Firebase dependencies are installed

### Runtime errors
- Verify Firebase project is active in Firebase Console
- Check that Firestore and Authentication are enabled
- Review Firebase security rules

## Next Steps

1. Configure the GitHub repository secrets with your Firebase credentials
2. Push changes to trigger a new deployment
3. Verify Firebase initialization in the deployed application
4. Test Firebase features (alerts, subscriptions, etc.)

## Security Best Practices

- Never commit `.env` file to the repository
- Regularly rotate Firebase API keys
- Use Firebase Security Rules to protect data
- Monitor Firebase usage in the Firebase Console
- Set up budget alerts in Firebase to prevent unexpected costs
